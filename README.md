# String Library Project

A simple and organized C++ class for string manipulation.  
This project includes a wide range of utility functions such as:

- Word counting  
- Case conversion (upper, lower, invert)  
- Splitting and joining strings  
- Trimming (left, right, both)  
- Counting characters, capital letters, small letters, vowels  
- Removing punctuation  
- Reversing word order  
- Replacing words

> It also demonstrates how to use Microsoft's `__declspec(property)` extension to simulate C#-style properties for getter/setter access.

## Purpose

This project is mainly for learning purposes and can be reused in small C++ applications that require custom string handling.

## Usage

You can use the class directly by including `clsString.h` in your project and creating an instance of `clsString`.
